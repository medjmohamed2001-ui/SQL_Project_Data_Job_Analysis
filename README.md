# Background  
Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining what to learn for career growth and optimal earning.

The data was sourced from Luke Barousse's SQL Course, offering comprehensive insights into job titles, salaries, locations, and required skills.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn (high demand and high salary)?

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here's how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

# What I Learned
Throughout this adventure, I've turbocharged my SQL toolkit with some serious firepower:

**Complex Query Crafting:** Mastered the art of advanced SQL, merging tables like a pro and wielding WITH clauses for ninja-level temp table maneuvers.

**Data Aggregation:** Got cozy with GROUP BY and turned aggregate functions like COUNT() and AVG() into my data-summarizing sidekicks.

**Analytical Wizardry:** Leveled up my real-world puzzle-solving skills, transforming questions into actionable, insightful SQL queries.

# Conclusions
### Insights
From the analysis, several **important insights** emerged:
- **Top salaries** reach up to $650,000 for remote positions
- **SQL proficiency** is critical for high-paying roles
- **Continuous learning** is essential in this evolving field
